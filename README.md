NoKunda is currently built for two platforms, Web and Android. Theft reports with pictures and exact location on the map can be uploaded via smartphone or Web.

On the Android platform, GPS coordinates are automatically added to the report with option of manual addition as well.

After the report has been approved by a government employee (back-end dashboard), all the reports appear on a live map with pictures and exact locations, thus enabling transparency and citizen engagement.

Addition of SMS reporting is also possible and planned.

NoKunda is an opensource app built on the opensource Ushahidi Platform.
